Settings file for file managers in Quick Access Popup

Last update 2015-10-11

Thanks to Roland Toth (tpr) for his help maintaining these settings (https://github.com/rolandtoth)


WHAT IS IT?

This QAPconnect settings file makes many popular file managers work with Quick Access Popup (QAP).
When configured for your file manager and selected in the QAP "Options -> File managers support"
dialog box, these settings allow QAP to change folder, open new folder, move or resize the file
manager window, etc. in your file manager.

Note 1
If you only use Windows Explorer and file dialog boxes (Open, Save As, etc.), you don't need to
care about this file. Just use QAP as it is.

Note 2
The file managers Directory Opus (www.gpsoft.com.au) and Total Commander (ghisler.com) are already
supported by QAP without needing additional settings in this file. To use one of these file
managers, select it in "Options -> File managers support".


HOW DOES IT WORK?

When QAP needs to open a new window (or tab) in a file manager or to change folder in the current
window, it needs to know what command to send to the file manager. This is done by selecting
your file manager in QAP "Options" dialog box. But, first, you need to make sure the info in this
file is OK for your installation of the file manager.


MAKING QUICK ACCESS POPUP WORK WITH YOUR FILE MANAGER

1. In the list below, find your file manager. File manager names are enclosed in square brackets.

2. Edit the "AppPath" parameter to reflect the current path to your file manager exe file.

3. Save this file keeping its actual name and location.

4. In Quick Access Popup, open the "Settings" window, click the "Options" button and select the
"File managers support" tab.

5. Select the "QAPconnect" radio button and choose your file manager in the "Application"
drop-down list.

Note
For users using QAP in a "portable" environment like an USB key, you can set a relative path for
your file manager exe file (i.e. "..\MyManager\MyManager.exe"). Path is relative to the QAP
working directory. If you used the standard setup, the working directory is under the Users
directory (for example, "C:\Users\Your Name\AppData\Roaming\Quick Access Popup\"). If you
prefered the portable installation, it is the directory where QAP exe file is running.


ADDING A FILE MANAGER

Actually, over 15 file managers are supported in QAPconnect.ini. If your custom file manager is
not in QAPconnect.ini, you can add it to the list if it meets certain conditions. The main
condition is that it must accept commands via the command line to open a new window, open a new
tab (if applicable) or change the folder in the current file manager's window.

1. To add a file manager, add a new section at the bottom of this file with the name and version of
your file manager between square brackets [...]. For example (do not include the semi-colons):

; [MyManager (v1.2.3)]
; AppPath=
; CommandLine=
; NewTabSwitch=

2. Set your file manager path and command line options:

   a) "AppPath": path to your custom file manager application (absolute or relative)
   
   b) "CommandLine": parameters that will be passed to the application (set in "AppPath")
      - the placeholder %Path% will be replaced with the path of the favorite folder selected in
        QAP popup menu
      - the placeholder %NewTabSwitch% will be replaced with the "NewTabSwitch" parameter (see
        below)
      
   c) "NewTabSwitch" (optional): command line parameter to open folder in a new tab (if available)
      or in a new instance of your file manager. "NewTabSwitch" is used only when you ask Quick
      Access Popup to open a folder in a new window. It will tell QAP how to to open the folder in
      a new tab instead of a new window.
      
   d) "CompanionPath" (optional): path to a command line executable, companion of the main file
      manager executable. For example, "EF Commander Free" main application is
      EFCommanderFreePortable.exe. But a second executable EFCWT.EXE is used to open or change
      folders. Setting the "CompanionPath" helps QAP manage properly file manager windows.

3. Save this file. In QAP, close and re-open the "Options" dialog box to reflect your changes
   in QAPconnect.ini.
